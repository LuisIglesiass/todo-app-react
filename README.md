# FocusList

FocusList is a simple and clean to-do list app built with React and Vite. It allows users to create, complete, and manage tasks efficiently while also tracking task statistics. All data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`, so nothing gets lost on refresh.

- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- Track total tasks and completed tasks in real-time
- Data persistence via `localStorage`
- Responsive UI with animated task appearance
- Dropdown options (Edit/Delete) per task
- Basic accessibility (keyboard shortcuts: Enter, Esc)
- Clean and modern UI using plain CSS
